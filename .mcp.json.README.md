# .mcp.json.example

**Purpose:** Configuration example for Claude Desktop (NOT used by news-mcp application)

---

## What is this file?

This file is an **example configuration** for Claude Desktop users who want to enable Playwright MCP tools in their Claude Desktop client.

**Important:** This file is NOT used by the news-mcp application itself. It is only relevant if you are using Claude Desktop and want to test the frontend interactively via MCP.

---

## Usage (Claude Desktop Only)

If you use Claude Desktop and want Playwright tools available:

1. Copy this file to your Claude Desktop config:
   ```bash
   # macOS
   cp .mcp.json.example ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json

   # Linux
   cp .mcp.json.example ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

2. Edit the config to merge with existing settings (don't overwrite!)

3. Restart Claude Desktop

4. Verify with `/mcp` command - should show "playwright" server

## What This Enables

With this config, Claude Desktop will have access to:
- `playwright_launch_browser` - Launch browser
- `playwright_navigate` - Navigate to URLs
- `playwright_click` - Click elements
- `playwright_screenshot` - Take screenshots
- `playwright_fill` - Fill forms
