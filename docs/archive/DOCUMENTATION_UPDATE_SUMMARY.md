## 🔍 Key Findings

### Issues Identified
1. **Duplicate Schema Files:**
   - `docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` (uppercase - needs consolidation)
   - `docs/Database-Schema.md` (mixed-case - currently used)
   - **Action:** Consolidate into single file

2. **Outdated Metrics:**
   - Many docs had stale statistics from September
   - Feed counts, item counts, analysis runs were outdated
   - **Action:** All updated to current values

3. **Missing Content Distribution Docs:**
   - New Special Reports feature not documented
   - LLM instruction system not explained
   - **Action:** Added to Database-Schema.md, needs standalone guide

4. **Service Architecture Changes:**
   - Analysis Worker service was undocumented
   - Feed Scheduler runner file path changed
   - **Action:** All updated in NAVIGATOR and ARCHITECTURE

### Documentation Gaps (Future Work)
- [ ] Content Distribution User Guide (new feature)
- [ ] Feed Scheduler Documentation
- [ ] System Recovery Procedures
- [ ] Wiki guides update (Priority 3)
